# odin-recipes
Pre-Project:
This is my first project using HTML. This project is a website consisting of a main index page which will have links to some recipes. The website will be very plain considering it only uses HTML. This project will be the first challenge presented to me on my coding journey to becoming a full-stack developer. Nevertheless, I hope this will benefit me greatly by showing me errors in my methods and programming

Post-Project:
Finished my first project using HTML. It wasn't difficult thanks to the Odin Project's teachings. Although, it was a little more labour intensive than I realized considering it was a lot of copy and pasting. Overall, this was a fun project to do.
